# Excel-and-Email-Scam-Project: Made by Bao Tran Huy Duc for TH Hoa Lac Coding Club
The project is about using Python, openpyxl, and smtplib to read customer information from an excel sheet and send emails to those customers.
The project takes me a total of roughly of 4 hours.
"Python Email Video.mp4" is a video showing what happens when the code is run.
